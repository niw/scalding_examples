Missing JDK File?
=================

Oracle JDK 1.6 is distributed as a self-expand binary.

You need manually download ``jdk-6u45-linux-x64-rpm.bin`` from [Oracle web page](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase6-419409.html) and place it here.

See ``modules/jdk_6/manifests/init.pp`` as well.
